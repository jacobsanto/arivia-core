# Arivia Villas Operations App - Phase 2 Egress Optimization Report

## Current Status: Phase 2 Implementation Complete ✅

### Issues Identified
1. **Repeated Profile Fetch Failures**: Multiple failed requests to `/profiles` endpoint causing unnecessary egress
2. **Unoptimized Dashboard Queries**: Multiple separate database calls instead of single optimized function calls
3. **No Query Deduplication**: Same queries being executed simultaneously 
4. **Insufficient Caching**: Short cache times causing frequent refetches
5. **No Request Monitoring**: No visibility into egress usage patterns

### Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. Intelligent Query Caching ✅
- **useOptimizedAuth.ts**: 5-minute profile cache with exponential backoff
- **useOptimizedDashboard.ts**: 2-minute dashboard metrics cache
- **useOptimizedQueries.ts**: Stale-time optimizations (3-30 minutes based on data type)

#### 2. Request Deduplication ✅
- **authOptimizer.ts**: Prevents duplicate API calls with pending request tracking
- **SessionManager**: Optimized token refresh with minimum 5-minute intervals

#### 3. Error Handling & Monitoring ✅
- **useEgressMonitor.ts**: Real-time tracking of request count, size, and errors
- **Database Migration**: Added `egress_monitoring` table for historical analysis
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests, no retry for auth errors

#### 4. Query Pattern Optimization ✅
- Replaced multiple database calls with single RPC function calls
- Added pagination for large datasets (inventory, users)
- Implemented proper error boundaries to prevent cascade failures

### Performance Improvements

#### Before Optimization:
- ❌ 4-6 separate queries per dashboard load
- ❌ Profile fetched on every auth state change
- ❌ No deduplication (same query triggered multiple times)
- ❌ 30-second cache times causing frequent refetches

#### After Optimization:
- ✅ Single RPC call for dashboard metrics
- ✅ 5-minute profile cache with error handling
- ✅ Request deduplication prevents duplicate calls
- ✅ 2-30 minute cache times based on data volatility
- ✅ Real-time egress monitoring with alerts

### Egress Reduction Estimate
- **Dashboard Loading**: ~75% reduction (6 queries → 1 RPC call)
- **Profile Fetching**: ~90% reduction (cache + deduplication)
- **Failed Request Loops**: ~95% reduction (exponential backoff)
- **Overall Expected Reduction**: 60-80% of current egress usage

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Real-time console logging in development mode
- Database logging for production analysis  
- Automatic alerts for high request counts (>50/minute)
- Error rate tracking and thresholds

### Next Steps (Phase 3)
- Implement session optimization
- Add request compression for large payloads
- Optimize realtime subscriptions
- Fine-tune cache durations based on usage patterns
