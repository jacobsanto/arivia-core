# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Arivia Villas Operations App.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the project, including the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that motivated this decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-001: Authentication System Consolidation](./001-auth-consolidation.md)
- [ADR-002: Console Logging Strategy](./002-console-logging.md)
- [ADR-003: Code Quality Standards](./003-code-quality.md)

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template from `adr-template.md`
2. Number sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Use kebab-case for filenames
4. Update this README with the new ADR
